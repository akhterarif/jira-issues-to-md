# jira-issues-to-md
List out the issues of a Sprint in [output.md](https://github.com/ubuntuarif/jira-issues-to-md/blob/develop/output.md) file.
One can format the output by changing the [format.md](https://github.com/ubuntuarif/jira-issues-to-md/blob/develop/format.md)file.

Though it is developed by me but the original Idea credit goes to [Dip Vaia](https://github.com/0PEIN0).
